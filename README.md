# weatherApp

This is the final project for my 10-week beginner iOS development class run by Cornell University's CUAppDev team.

In this project, I set out to build a weather application, using DarkSky's API.

I implemented the following for this app:
Alamofire and SwiftyJSON to fetch & parse data. 
GooglePlaces to set up my autocomplete view for finding cities.
Realm Swift to save data locally.
